Six Battle Born 100Ah 12V batteries are connected in parallel providing 600Ah at 12V.

The batteries are (re)charged through:
* [solar](Solar.md)
* Shore power (that feeds into the [inverter](inverter.md))

The BMV-712 battery monitor is used to monitor the batteries.

The batteries provide power/electricity to both DC and AC circuits.

It's the AC circuits that "get exciting."  We use [Victrons Multiplus 12/3000/120-50 120v Inverter](inverter.md)
