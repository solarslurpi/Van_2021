We have an (AC) appliance cabinet where the water heater, microwave, and refrigerator are located.

_Note: The microwave has been removed from the image so that we can work on the outlets._
# Appliance Power Characteristics
We measured the power consumption using the BMV-712 UI.
## Water Heater
The Water Heater is a Bosch 3000T.  The water heater requires the most power of any of the appliances when it is on heating water.

The voltage when there is no load is typically above 13.5V.  

Notice the [voltage discharge as the water is being heated](https://youtu.be/0e5vgFTGCzc).

## Induction Cooktop
We plugged in our [Induction Cooktop](https://amzn.to/3b5QC9T) and started [monitoring its energy use](https://youtu.be/AjyHANofmwg) as we bumped the power on one of the burners to 10.

During our two minute test:
* The voltage dropped from 13.3V to 13.05V.
* The Current went from about 40A to around 60A when the power was at 10.
* The Power went from around 288W to 700W.

_Note: I need to do more testing since it seems to me these are lower than expected?_

## Microwave

## Popcorn Popper
# Wiring
The three appliances are plugged into wall warts located in a space between the fridge and microwave.  The shelf holding the microwave can be removed to allow us to work on the wiring to the plugs.

## Water Heater Plug
The water heater has a dedicated AC circuit. The plug closest to the wall of the van is wired for the water heater's power needs.
