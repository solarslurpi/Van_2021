# Batteries
We have installed 6 Battle Born 12V 100Ah batteries.  The 6 batteries are connected in [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits).  

## Output
Our system outputs 12V DC Power at a capacity of 600Ah.

## Charging
The batteries are charged by either:
* [Solar](Solar.md)
* On Shore

The [Battle Born Manual](https://www.solar-electric.com/lib/wind-sun/Battle_Born_Manual.pdf) gives great info on the characteristics of these batteries.

DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS PARAGRAPH BECAUSE INVERTER ASKS FOR BETWEEN 100 and 200 A?

The BMS will not allow a current that exceeds 100 (+/- 5%) Amps for 30s, or 200 (+/- 10%) Amps for 0.5s.
Although these thresholds have been verified with a DC load bank, the 30 second high current threshold
may be reduced from 200A to around 150A for certain highly variable loads through an inverter â€“ like a
microwave or space heater. After a high current disconnection, the battery will automatically reconnect
after 5 seconds.


### State of Charge
We installed Victron's [BMV-712 - Battery Monitor](https://battlebornbatteries.com/faq-all-about-bmvs/).  As noted in Victron's ["Energy Unlimited"](./documents/Book-Energy-Unlimited-EN.pdf) document: 

```
A battery monitor keeps track of the current flowing in and out of the battery. Integration of this current over time (which if the current would be a fixed amount of amps, boils down to multiplying current and time) gives the amount of amp-hours flowing in or out of the battery. For example: a discharge current of 10 A for 2 hours means that the battery has been discharged by
10 x 2 = 20 Ah.
```
...__To calculate Ah charge or discharge of a battery, a battery monitor only makes use of current and time__
