Hey Margaret,

Thanks for the email.

No worries, glad I could help out on this.

West Virginia has a lot of great places to see. My favorite place in West Virginia is White Sulfer Springs and Lewisburg. White Sulfer Springs is home to the Greenbrier Resort, and Lewisurg is one of the most popular towns in the state. This will take you through the Greenbrier Valley and allow you to see some beautiful scenery. Fayetteville is also located in the southern portion of the state and has really cool viewing spots of the New Rive Gorge Bridge, which is a vey iconic bridge in the state. 
Thanks,
Aaron
